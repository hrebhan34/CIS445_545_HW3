    <h2 id="reflection.html">Reflection</h2>
    <p>As I reflect on my young life, I am super proud of what I have overcome and where I am now. Everyone has there own stories and each is unique in its own way.
        I have gone through a lot of ups and downs and never imagined myself to have even furthered my education to where it is at now. I value my education that much more
        due to this. I plan on continuing my education after graduation and most likely a few years into my career. I want to continue learning as long as I can, espically 
        with the oppertunities presented to me throughout my career. I am proud of who I am, and excited for who I am to become.
