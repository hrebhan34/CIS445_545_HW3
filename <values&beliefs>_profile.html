<p>I believe in the mindset of "I can do anything I set my mind too." I carry this with me through my personal, as well as professional life. I am dedicated to my work and once I start a project, it will get completed to the best of my ability. 
I am grateful for the generation I grew up in because I have the power of so much knowledge at just the click of a button. I do not believe in using the excuse of not knowing how to do something beacuse the internet is a powerful resource that has any answer you may be looking for. </p>
