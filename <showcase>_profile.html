    <p>One thing that I am most proud and passionate about is the work I do with service dogs. I am apart of an organization called Paws Giving Independece
        which places service dogs cost free to those who need them in the Peoria area. These dogs can range upward of $15,000 which is why the volunteer work 
        those involved in this oganization do is so important. Having to take full responability, as well as train a dog while being a full time student has taught
        me more responsability than I can imagine. Growing a bond with these dogs, knowing I will eventually have to give them up is the most bittersweet goodbye. Watching 
        a dog find a recipant in need is the most fufilling feeling because I know I was a small part in giving that person back the independece they deserve.
