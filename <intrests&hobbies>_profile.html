<p>One of the biggest passions I have found throughout my time at Bradley is training service dogs! I joined Wags for Mags my sophmore year and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. 
    Not only have I met some amazing people through the program, but I also get to have a huge impact in both the dogs life as well as the recipent. I help train dogs for various purposes including 
    wheelchair mobility, seeing eye dogs, medical alert, and facility. It is a big time commitment but the reward of placing a dog cost free to someone that is able to regain their independence with 
    the help of these dogs is worth it.
