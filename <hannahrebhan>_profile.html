<h2>Brief Biogrpahy:</h2>
<p>I am Hannah Rebhan, a junior at Bradley University. I am majoring in Computer Information Systems with a minor in Buisness Management and Leadership. I am from Plainfield, Illinois which is about two hours away from campus in a Chicago suburb.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Values and Beliefs:</h3>
<p>I believe in the mindset of "I can do anything I set my mind too." I carry this with me through my personal, as well as professional life. I am dedicated to my work and once I start a project, it will get completed to the best of my ability. 
I am grateful for the generation I grew up in because I have the power of so much knowledge at just the click of a button. I do not believe in using the excuse of not knowing how to do something beacuse the internet is a powerful resource that has any answer you may be looking for. </p>
<hr>
<h4>Career Aspirations:</h4>
<p>I am looking for a front end software position out of college. I also want to focus more on the buisness side of web developement in order to apply my passion I have found through my minor. </p>
